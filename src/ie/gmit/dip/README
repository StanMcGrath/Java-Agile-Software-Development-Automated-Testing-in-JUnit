Hello,

There are some important things to note about this project listed below.

1) 

The main programme sits in InsuranceProgram.java. We are aware that this class violates 
the SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) as all programme logic is contained within this same
class. However, due to the scope of this project, the large number of test classes it contains,
and the simplicity of the main programme, we deemed this a necessary evil to avoid package 
level clutter and improve readability (for our own development purposes). This was a design 
choice.

2) 

Many conflicts were encountered using Junit Jupiter and our edition of eclipse.
Many of the imports and annotations as per our lab materials/instructional videos were
already deprecated by the time of writing of this project. (JUnit Platform for the Test Class 
runner particularly). To work around this we had to update our Runner to run with Suite 
(from JUnit 4), as per instructional resources we found online and others having similar
problems. As a result of this, Our Test Suite Runner (Test Runner) was not compatible with 3 of
our test classes. Our Test Runner does not recognise the @ParameterizedTest Annotation as a 
runnable method- so the Test class which makes use of this annotation, 
"AccidentsCheckerTestClass", is omitted from the Test Suite Runner. However, this test can be 
run manually on its own, and passes. Similarly, two more test classes- "AccidentsInputTestClass" 
and "AgeInputTestClass" have also been omitted from the Test Suite Runner, as the Exceptions 
within them (which are the purpose of the tests) are not thrown when called through the Test 
Runner, resulting in the tests failing. However, these two tests can also be run manually on 
their own, and they both pass.
